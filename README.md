# Interdisciplinary Numerical Methods: Parallelism in Julia "Spoke" 18.S192/16.S098

This course covers the the methods available to write high performance parallel codes in Julia, including threading, GPU acceleration, and distributed programming with MPI and Dagger.jl. 

By the end of the course students will be able to use Julia to write write portable and performant code that scales from their laptop CPUs to GPU-enabled supercomputer clusters like NERSC Perlmutter. These skills will be illustrated with a set of applications including scientific codes like Gray-Scott, and training large scale AI applications like LLMs.
