# Interdisciplinary Numerical Methods: Parallelism in Julia "Spoke" 18.S192/16.S098 (2025)
(aka Undergraduate Parallel Computing)

We cover  the methods available to write high performance parallel codes in Julia, including threading, GPU acceleration, and distributed programming with MPI and Dagger.jl. 

By the end of the course students will be able to write portable and performant code that scales from their laptop CPUs to GPU-enabled supercomputer clusters like NERSC Perlmutter. These skills will be illustrated with a set of applications including scientific codes like Gray-Scott, and training large scale AI applications like LLMs.

## Logistics

**Lectures:** Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays 11 AM - 12 AM in room 36-144.

**Prerequisites:** 18.03, 18.06, or equivalents, and some programming experience. You should have taken the [first half-semester numerical "hub" 18.S190/16.S090](https://github.com/mitmath/numerical_hub). Familiarity with Julia is assumed.

**Instructors:** A. Edelman

**Teaching Assistants:** Raye Kimmerer, Eveylne Ringoot, Rabab Alomairy

**Office Hours:** 
- Raye on Tuesdays and Thursdays 12:45PM - 1:45PM in 32-G780. A map can be found here: [Map](https://www.csail.mit.edu/sites/default/files/resources/maps/7G/G780.gif), be sure you take the Gates tower elevators **not** the Dreyfoos tower elevators!!!


**Lecture Recordings:** ( Hopefully) Available on Canvas under the Panopto Video tab. Should be published the evening after each lecture.
